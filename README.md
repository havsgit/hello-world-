# hello-world-
Testing the functionality of GitHub. 
Attention everyone. I am a begginer in this programming forum and i would like to learn and contribute  stuff as much as i can. Programming is a field of computing i like most though i started late in my life.I still have to learn a lot about programming languages which i feel will help me to sharpen my knowledge and skills.
